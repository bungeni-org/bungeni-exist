Bungeni is a suite of applications that provide a solution for drafting, managing, consolidating and publishing legislative and other parliamentary documents. It aims to increase the efficiency of parliamentary activities and make Parliaments more open and accessible to citizens -- virtually allowing them “inside the Parliament” or Bungeni, the Kiswahili word for “inside the Parliament”.

Bungeni deals with the growing and challenging demands of increasing the efficiency of parliamentary activities and at the same time enabling Parliaments become more open to the citizens to foster accessibility, transparency and accountability of parliamentary activities.
