XQ-Framework
-------------

The XQ-Framework uses the following application structure.

The main files for the framework:
  
  * config.xqm - this configures the environment variables
  * controller.xql - this is the controller script for the framework and decides what gets executed for specific requests.
  * template.xqm - this is the main templating logic.

The application using the framework must reside in a sub-folder of the framework.

The resoures (css, images, js ) must also reside in a sub-folder of the framework.

The template for the application must reside in the framework folder.
