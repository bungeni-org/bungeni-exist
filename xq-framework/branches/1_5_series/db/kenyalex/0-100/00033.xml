  Provided that, where necessaries are sold and delivered to an infant or minor, or to a person who by reason of mental incapacity or drunkenness is incompetent to contract, he must pay a reasonable price therefor.

Subject to the provisions of this Act and of any Act in that behalf, a contract of sale may be made in writing (either with or without seal) or by word of mouth, or partly in writing and partly by word of mouth, or may be implied from the conduct of the parties: 
</xhtml:div><xhtml:div>

</xhtml:div><xhtml:div>
  (2) The provisions of this section apply to every such contract, notwithstanding that the goods may be intended to be delivered at some future time, or may not at the time of the contract be actually made, procured or provided, or fit or ready for delivery, or some act may be requisite for the making or completing thereof, or rendering them fit for delivery.

</xhtml:div><xhtml:div>
  &#160; 
</xhtml:div><xhtml:div>
  (2) Where the price is not determined in accordance with the foregoing provisions, the buyer must pay a reasonable price; and what is a reasonable price is a question of fact dependent on the circumstances of each particular case.

  &#160; 
</xhtml:div><xhtml:div>
  Provided that if the goods or any part thereof have been delivered to and appropriated by the buyer he must pay a reasonable price therefor. 
</xhtml:div><xhtml:div>
  &#160; 
</xhtml:div><xhtml:div>
  (2) Where the third party is prevented from making the valuation by the fault of the seller or buyer, the party not at fault may maintain an action for damages against the party at fault.

  (2) Whether any other stipulation as to time is of the essence of the contract or not depends on the terms of the contract.

(1) Where a contract of sale is subject to any condition to be fulfilled by the seller, the buyer may waive the condition, or may elect to treat the breach of condition as a breach of warranty and not as a ground for treating the contract as repudiated. 
</xhtml:div><xhtml:div>
  &#160; 
</xhtml:div><xhtml:div>
  (2) Whether a stipulation in a contract of sale is a condition the breach of which may give rise to a right to treat the contract as repudiated, or a warranty the breach of which may give rise to a claim for damages but not to a right to reject the goods and treat the contract as repudiated, depends in each case on the construction of the contract; and a stipulation may be a condition, though called a warranty in the contract. 
</xhtml:div><xhtml:div>
  &#160; 
</xhtml:div><xhtml:div>
  (3) Where a contract of sale is not severable and the buyer has accepted the goods or part thereof, or where the contract is for specific goods the property in which has passed to the buyer, the breach of any conditions to be fulfilled by the seller can only be treated as a breach of warranty and not as a ground for rejecting the goods and treating the contract as repudiated, unless there be a term of the contract, express or implied, to that effect.

Subject to the provisions of this Act, when the buyer of goods becomes insolvent, the unpaid seller who has parted with the possession of the goods has the right of stopping them <xhtml:i>in transitu</xhtml:i>, that is to say, he may resume possession of the goods as long as they are in course of transit, and may retain them until payment or tender of the price.

  (3) If, after the arrival of the goods at the appointed destination, the carrier or other bailee or custodier acknowledges to the buyer, or his agent, that he holds the goods on his behalf and continues in possession of them as bailee or custodier for the buyer, or his agent, the transit is at an end, and it is immaterial that a further destination for the goods may have been indicated by the buyer.
